Kind2 WIP
=========

Kind1 has been developed in JavaScript, which wasn't meant to be a long-term
solution, but allowed us to explore self-types. Recently, we started developing
Kind2 for [HVM1](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM1), but it has been
discontinued when we started working on HVM2. In this repository, we'll remake
and continue Kind2's development, now targetting HVM2. Kind2 will be fully
implemented in itself. Temporarily, we're using `TypeScript+HVM1` to aid on the
bootstrapping process.

Usage
=====

1. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

2. Install [HVM1](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM1).

3. Install Kind2: `npm i -g` (from this directory)

4. Enter `book/` and run with `kind2 [check|run] term_name`.
