Kind2 WIP
=========

Kind1 has been developed in JavaScript, which wasn't meant to be a long-term
solution, but allowed us to explore self-types. Recently, we started developing
Kind2 for [HVM1](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM1), but it has been
discontinued when we started working on HVM2. In this repository, we'll remake
and continue Kind2's development, now targetting HVM2.
